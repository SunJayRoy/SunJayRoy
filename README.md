- 👋 Hi, I’m @SunJayRoy
- 👀 I’m interested in being part of a dev team that makes FPS games. In particular I want to be able to program gameplay mechanics and the games corresponding physics. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c++ because I want to ultimately make a Call Of Duty killer. I am also interested in learning java or python for professional reasons.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything!
- 📫 Reach me on twitter @sunjayroytweets or on gmail at sonny.parrington@gmail.com
